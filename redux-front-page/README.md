# Redux Front Page

This site aims to solve the Redux documentation fragmentation problem by providing a unified, searchable interface for all Redux-related resources.

## The Problem

Redux's documentation and resources are currently spread across multiple sites and platforms:
- Multiple documentation sites
- Scattered content across different platforms

This site aims to create a centralized that makes it easier to find and navigate Redux-related information.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by community feedback about Redux documentation accessibility, particularly the discussion raised in [this post](https://bsky.app/profile/acemarke.dev/post/3lngz256amc27) by Mark Erikson (Redux maintainer).

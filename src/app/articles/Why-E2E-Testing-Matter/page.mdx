### Benefits of E2E Testing

1. **Testing Real-World Scenarios:** Tests are conducted on actual browsers, closely replicating manual operations in a production environment.
2. **Detection of Regression:** After introducing new code, it ensures that existing functionalities are not broken.

### Benefits of Visual Testing

1. **Consistency in Design, Issue Detection:** Without manually displaying every page on PC, tablet, and mobile, you can find screens with design inconsistencies or display issues.
2. **Cross-Browser, Cross-Device Compatibility:** It allows testing whether the UI is displayed correctly across different browsers and devices.

### Risks of Not Implementing E2E and Visual Testing

1. **Undetected Regression:** When new code or existing code changes, unnoticed defects that occur outside of manual checks in PRs might be deployed in the production environment.
2. **Increased Maintenance Costs:** Changes in common UI or logic necessitate manual checks across PCs, tablets, and mobiles for all affected areas.
3. **Inability to Update Node.js and npm:** Without E2E and visual testing, code changes or updates unrelated to functional requirements are nothing but risks. After the end of support for Node 18 (April 30, 2025), you will be left with a vulnerable system constantly fearing security risks.
4. **Increased Developer Turnover and Recruitment Challenges:** The majority of the work being manual QA and with a legacy tech stack, the environment is not attractive for engineers who want to hone their development skills, leading to increased turnover rates.

E2E and visual testing are extremely important, especially for complex web applications, in delivering high-quality software. Properly conducting these tests can enhance user satisfaction and support long-term success.

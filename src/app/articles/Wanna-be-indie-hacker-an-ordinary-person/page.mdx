Paid work was off today.  
I can't perform good enough for laststance.io work as a indie hacker.  
I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not talented enough. Just a ordinary guy.  
But computer programming is the only thing I can do. I'm not good at anything else.

The problem is lacking stamina. I can't work for a long time. I can't focus on one thing for a long time.  
Might be lerning English and into the Javascirpt community that 100% English is used feild is high workload for me because I'm Japanese.

Overcome English fatige makes me better I hope.

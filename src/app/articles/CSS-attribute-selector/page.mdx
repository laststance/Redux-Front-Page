The `[popover]` syntax in CSS is an `attribute selector`.
That has many syntax variation so get meaning is always sluggish for me.
But this is so Strong-willed within TailwindCSS [Data attributes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#data-attributes).

### Basic Attribute Selector

- **`[attribute]`**: This selector matches all elements that have the specified attribute, regardless of the value of the attribute. In your case, `[popover]` will select all elements that have a `popover` attribute, no matter what value it holds.

### Example Usage

To use the basic `[popover]` attribute selector in HTML and CSS, you might have HTML like this:

And CSS that applies styling to these elements could look like this:

```html
<div popover="true">This div has a popover.</div>
<button popover>This button also has a popover.</button>
```

```css
[popover] {
  border: 1px solid blue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This CSS rule applies a blue border and padding to any element that has the `popover` attribute, demonstrating how attribute selectors enable styling based on the presence of attributes in HTML elements.

### Other Variants of Attribute Selectors

There are several variations of attribute selectors that provide more specific targeting based on the value of the attribute:

- **`[attribute="value"]`**: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a matching value exactly equal to the given string.
- **`[attribute~="value"]`**: Matches elements with the attribute whose space-separated list of values contains the specified value.
- **`[attribute|="value"]`**: Targets elements with the attribute value starting with the specified value followed by an optional hyphen, useful for language sub-codes.
- **`[attribute^="value"]`**: Matches elements whose attribute value begins with the specified string.
- **`[attribute$="value"]`**: Selects elements whose attribute value ends with the specified string.
- **`[attribute*="value"]`**: Matches elements whose attribute value contains the specified substring anywhere within it.

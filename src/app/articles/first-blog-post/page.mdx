Laststance.io was originally a place for [npm package namespace](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-organization-scopes-and-packages) because there was exact same naming package at the time.

Currently, there is only one package that [eslint-config-ts-prefixer](https://github.com/laststance/eslint-config-ts-prefixer) has been released, but I have several wip packages and I'm motivated to complete them to publish.

I ain't the type to grind full-time in a corporate scene,\
Three days a week, contract work, that's how I make my green,\
Crafting the next-gen Web Application Framework's my dream,\
Like Dan Abramov, no half measures, that's my scheme,\
Do it right, brand it tight, clean profits are my theme.

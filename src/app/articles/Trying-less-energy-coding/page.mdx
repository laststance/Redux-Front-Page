I'm currently working on the subject of how I can code with less energy.

I was amazed when I watched [JoshuaKGoldberg's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/joshuakgoldberg) live stream and he was typing and filing Issue reports as fast as he could breathe.  
I thought that if I could code like that and write PR descriptions, I would be more productive and enjoy coding with ease.
